# Day 3: Basic Arithmetic Operations #3
## *Task*: Perform basic arithmetic using Python.

*Description*:
In Python, you can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`). These operations can be done with numbers stored in variables.

*Example*:
```python
# Ask the user for two numbers and perform arithmetic operations
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Perform basic operations
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2

# Display the results
print("Addition:", addition)
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
print("Division:", division)


#After doing these basic operations also find floor division, modulus and power of num1 and num2
