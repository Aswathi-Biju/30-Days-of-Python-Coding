# Day 2: Variables and Input #2
## *Task*: Use variables and input to write a program.

*Description*:
In Python, variables are used to store information that can be referenced and manipulated later. The `input()` function allows the user to enter information, which you can then store in a variable. Use the `print()` function to display the results.

*Example*:
```python
# Ask for the user's name and age, then print a message
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")

print("Hello " + name + "! You are " + age + " years old.")

# Now try to make your own:
Try creating a simple program that asks for the user's favorite color and prints a message including the color.
