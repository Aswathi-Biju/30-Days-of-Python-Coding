# Day 8: For Loop #8
## *Task*: Use a for loop to iterate over a sequence.

*Description*:
A `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, string, or range of numbers). It allows you to repeat actions for each item in the sequence.

*Example*:
```python
# Print each character in the string "Python"
for char in "Python":
    print("Character:", char)



# Write a program that:
Uses a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number, print whether it is even or odd.
